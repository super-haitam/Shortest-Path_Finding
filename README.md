# Shortest-Path Finding

### PURPOSE
This project is supposed to find the Shortest-Path from a starting point to an ending point using the A* pathfinding algorithm.

### FEATURES
It allows the user to:
	-Either draw his own maze with the given drawing tools _Walls_, _Path_, _Start Point_ and _End Point_.
	-Or Choose between a set of maze sizes and the program will randomly pick a maze with that size.

### CONCLUSION
Well, I made that to challenge myself to do some tougher projects, other that game projects, cuz I don't want to become a game developer but a software engineer.
Wanted to thank "Sebastian League" for his video about A* PathFinding Algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE
Enjoy!
